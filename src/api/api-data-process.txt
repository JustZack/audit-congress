Everything that needs to happen between fetching from api.congress.gov to the final cache of that data.

1. Determine what data matters for a given route.
    a. A bill should gather most of its sub-routes immediately
    b. But a bills sub-route will only need its own data
    c. Recent bill listing needs to know some sub-routes of the bill they represent
    d. Overall, need to create functions that handle this 'translation'
2. In Parallel, ask the cache for each route
    a. Spawn a thread
    b. Ask cache for the route, but don't save the return data
        1. Cache handles fetching, translating, and caching data
        2. All the data could already be cached before this point
    c. Join the thread
3. ask cache for each route cache
