[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/17a5f75a6d1ff92adf90/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/JustZack/audit-congress/maintainability)

A project aiming to make data available via api.congress.gov easily accessable and easy to understand. 

Congress.gov currently exists and uses this api though works like a database of information. 
You have to know what you want before searching for it.
I'd like my app to hook all the API data together so the daily actions of congress are completly transparent. 
Additionally, I'd like to take advantage of the vote data sheets supplied in this api to keep track of how representatives vote in congress.

My hope is to make myself a more informed citizen by creating such an app.
